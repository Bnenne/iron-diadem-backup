## Cold Weather !hide
- Characters not wearing adequate cold protection must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion.
- 1 pound a day for full, 1/2 pound a day for conserving (Counts as half a day without eating, meaning 2 conserving days is one level of exhaustion)

## Matt !hide
Asking about his why he took an oath
- ASK QUESTIONS

> *Eryn is quiet for a moment, watching the snow fall.*
> "You know, when I found the kids, I had no idea what I was doing. I'd never been responsible for anyone but myself."
> *Pause*
> "But then I remembered what my father said... he told me something before I left 'Protecting people isn't about being perfect. It's about showing up.'"
> *She looks at Matt*
> "You showed up. For this rebellion, for these people, for those kids. That matters."

> "You know what? I've been thinking about that a lot lately."
> 
> _She sits down with the kids, gestures for the party to listen too_
> 
> "When this is all over. When we've won. When the King is gone and magic is legal again and people aren't hunting us anymore..."
> 
> _Deep breath, like she's letting herself dream_
> 
> "I want to go to the coast."
> 
> Caen: "The ocean? With the water?"
> 
> "Yes. The ocean. Back in the capitol where I used to live, but not in the slums..."
> 
> "And I want to get a little house. Nothing fancy. Just... big enough for all of us."
> 
> _She counts on her fingers_
> 
> "Four bedrooms. One for you, Laena. One for you, Eth. One for you, Caen. And one for me."
> 
> _Pause, glances at Matt_
> 
> "Maybe five. You know. Just in case."
### Aelrin !hide
Tries to set a boundary with him about picking on kids and less fortunate people

> "Atlas gave in. He let Kaelrath consume him. You're still here. Still fighting. Still YOU."
> *Quiet*
> "Don't let that voice convince you otherwise."
### Dutch !hide
Helping him believe he has real strength and can create real change
- Asking about his journey learning magic
- Maybe some specific questions about his backstory

> "You're incredibly smart, Dutch. But please don't let that go to your head, don't become another tyrant
> "You're brilliant, Dutch. But brilliance without humility is just tyranny with better vocabulary."
> *Softer*
> "Don't let that book turn you into someone who knows everything and understands nothing."
> 
> "So please promise me that in the future you'll build things up not tear them down. Promise me you'll create a world where magic isn't illegal, where kids can be kids without hiding who they are. A world filled with libraries and schools, where everyone can learn not just the rich or human."
> 
> "Can I tell you something I've never told anyone?... I can't read, well I can read some but, I grew up in the slums. The kids are actually better than me at reading. Eth reads to me sometimes, I'm proud of him."
> *Looks at Dutch*
> "You were born into knowledge. A noble family. Education. You've had opportunities I'll never have. Don't waste them. Don't let that gift die with you in this war. The world needs what you know."
> 
> "If you don't mind... can you teach them? The kids. Teach them magic, teach them history, teach them how to THINK. Eth especially. He's so curious. He could be incredible if someone actually nurtured that."
> _Pause_
> "And don't just teach them facts. Teach them to question. To doubt. To think critically."
> _Small smile_
> "Make them smarter than me. Shouldn't be hard."
## The [[Moonwell]] !hide
The path opens up into a clearing with a 10ft diameter pool of water in the center. The water is perfectly still and the pool is surrounded with stone with elvish runes carved into them.
il
What Eryn knows:
- These are very common in [[Realm of Aeloria|Aeloria]]
- They were created by ancient elves to glimpse into possible futures, they show what MIGHT happen, not what WILL happen

Arcana DC 14:
- These runes are protective—but old. Fading. The magic is weak now.
Perception DC 12:
- The water isn't reflecting the current moon. It's showing a full moon. And there are cracks spreading through the reflection.

Eryn tells everyone to back away but then the kids get too close and a blinding light pulls everyone into a vision.

The see a city on fire and being circled by ravens, and at the center, Kaelrath standing over a dead fox.
## Ice bridge !hide
- Gorge spanning 60 ft
- Bridge completely encased in ice, wooden boards, ropes, everything
- Perception DC 14
	- bridge sways in the wind and cracks from the ice, the ice is very slippery
	- loose and sagging ropes make the bridge unstable
	- opposite side has a winch
- Survival DC 12
	- too wide to jump without magic
	- climbing down and up may take 6+ hours with all the refugees
- Arcana DC 13
	- Magical ice
	- recent (last 24 hours)
- Investigation DC 15
	- Winch could tighten the ropes making them more stable
	- Can only hold about ~300 lbs.
	- Ice is already like ~200 lbs.
## Stories about Aeloria !hide
A tale about the enchanted gardens where certain flowers would chime like bells in the evening breeze. Eryn could describe how children would run through the garden paths at dusk, trying to make the flowers sing by spinning in circles, and how the whole garden would fill with tinkling music. Maybe she'd mention a specific flower, like moon-chimes, that only the children could make ring.

Story about the midsummer festival where everyone would craft paper lanterns and release them at midnight. Eryn could describe the sky filling with thousands of glowing lights, and the tradition that if you can release with a wish and it'll come true. She released one with a special wish.
