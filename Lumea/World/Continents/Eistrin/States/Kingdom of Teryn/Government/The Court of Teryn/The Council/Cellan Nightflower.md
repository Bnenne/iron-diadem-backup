# Biography !hide
Born to a once-revered [[Realm of Aeloria|Aelorian]] noble house, Cellan Nightflower was one of the few elves who aligned herself with [[Kingdom of Teryn|Teryn]] after the invasion, not out of fear, but opportunity. When her people called her a traitor, she called herself a realist. “The forest bows to fire,” she said, “or it burns.”

She rose through Teryn’s hierarchy with a dangerous mix of charm, intellect, and ruthlessness, quickly becoming the [[King Vaerin Albretcht|King's]] favored magical advisor. Her mastery of divine and infernal flame drew [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath's]] attention, or perhaps his infection simply recognized her hunger.

While [[Atlas Stahl|Atlas]] commands armies and people, Cellan commands influence, whispers, courtiers, and unseen forces. She rarely raises her voice, but her words have become law in every room she enters.
