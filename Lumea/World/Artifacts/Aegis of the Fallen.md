A massive round shield engraved with [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]]’s symbol, its surface cracked by divine flame. It drinks in blows meant for its bearer, but each strike absorbed deepens the corruption. The attuned feel invincible, and slowly, utterly fearless. Its surface shows visions of every soldier who has died believing in a false cause.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
You gain a +2 bonus to AC while wielding this shield.  
Once per short rest, when you take damage, you can reduce it by 10 as shadows absorb the blow.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

Each time you use this feature, your movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until you finish a long rest. After three uses without resting, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

You cannot sleep unless your back is against a wall or another creature stands guard. You start believing that unseen enemies stalk you, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to willingly turn your back to anyone in a tense situation. NPCs notice your wary, haunted demeanor. If an enemy creature moves behind you in combat you must DC 13 Wisdom saving throw in order to not turn to face that creature.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
