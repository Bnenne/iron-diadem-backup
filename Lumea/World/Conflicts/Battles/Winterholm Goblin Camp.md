# Lore
The Goblins were paid by the [[King Vaerin Albretcht|King]] to not just destroy [[Winterholm]] but to kill [[Matt Stonebridge]]. [[High Priest Marcion Vale]] received a prophecy of a soldier (Matt Stonebridge) who would rise up against the King.
- The goblins have gear they shouldn't
	- Military tents
	- Quality weapons
	- A chest of more gold than they should be able to acquire
- A [[Military Ledger|ledger]] recounting previous interactions with the King and [[Atlas Stahl]]
Since then the goblins have not been doing well, slowly dying off. Now, they live in a small camp among the ruins of what use to be a large ravenous goblin camp.
