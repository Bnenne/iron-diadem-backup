# Summary
After the successful ambush, the party meets [[Gronk Buffonry]], an acorn obsessed Half-Orc who joins their cause. Back at [[Vanguard Cirene]], they receive rewards, including magical items, a Bag of Holding and a mysterious axe.

[[Lira]] then briefs them on a new mission: infiltrate a noble hunting party in [[The Ornery Steeps]] to gather intelligence.

On the way, they defeat a Displacer Beast, survive an avalanche thanks to [[Dutch Roebal|Dutch's]] Wall of Fire, and finally reach the remote hunting lodge high in the mountains.
