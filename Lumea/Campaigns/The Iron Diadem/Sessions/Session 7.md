# Summary
After escaping the [[Chapel of the Hollow Flame|Temple of Kaelrath]], [[Aelrin Althir|Aelrin]] meets up with [[Eryn Talvane|Eryn]] and [[Matt Stonebridge|Matt]]. Eryn who is shocked by all this info convinces Aelrin to go back into the temple to grab the rest of the relics.

They sneak in the temple and and grab the [[Blade of Honor|sword]], [[Aegis of the Fallen|shield]], and [[Mandate of Fire]]. While trying to make there way out they encounter [[Atlas Stahl|Atlas]] again and the [[The Clergy|Clergy]] led by [[High Priest Marcion Vale]]. They set up a ritual in the room that has a pool with stairs. Aelrin and Eryn try to create a distraction by blowing around a cross so they can escape but are unsuccessful. Atlas undresses revealing vascular blood-red marks around his heart and he enters the pool. The pool fills with blood and Atlas goes completely under, eventually the level goes down and Atlas exits the pool drying off and dressing. The clergy leaves but Atlas stays, then enters a older women who they learn is named [[Mara Albretcht|Mara]]. Mara looks directly at them but doesn't say anything. She talks with Atlas and they learn that Atlas can hear [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath's]] voice.

> Mara: *"Do you hear his voice now?"*
> Atlas: *"Yes."*
> Mara: *"What is he saying?"*
> Atlas: *"He says... they're not telling me who I am... he says... he can tell me what I am."*

Then enters a younger elf they learn is named [[Cellan Nightflower|Cellan]], she talks to Atlas in a way that implies they're like siblings. Aelrin and Eryn take this opportunity to escape.

After regrouping, the party make their way back to [[Vanguard Cirene]]. On the way they find ruins related to Kaelrath, a large tower. They ascend the tower and find 4 large windows, but they don't show the outside. Rather, they show [[The Capital of Teryn]], [[The Capital of Aeloria]], the Throne room, and the temple they were just in. Matt notices a magical and almost corrupted energy coming from those 4 places, and Eryn points out some lenses in the room. While looking through the lenses they can see the energy much more clearly. They take the lenses and exit the tower.

After that, the party returns to the [[Vanguard Cirene]] camp and reports to [[Lira Thorne|Lira]], who is astonished. The leaders gather, equally stunned, and [[Kela Harrowen]] takes the relics to examine. Using her arcane detection methods, she confirms the sword, shield, and armor pieces are all undeniably tied to [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]]. She then has Matt attune to the armor, sword, and shield.

Kela mentions an oddity of her own: the small orb that has followed her for years, originally found in Kaelrath ruins, has a magical signature too faint to identify. The party gives her one of the tower’s lenses, and through it she sees the unmistakable Kaelrath energy. She asks Aelrin to attune to it.

With the relics confirmed, Lira assigns the party a new mission: travel to a mountain city where rebel civilians are hiding. Atlas Stahl is marching there, and the Vanguard fears he plans to wipe them out. Eryn joins the group, and they depart.

Their first stop is the burned, ruined remains of [[Winterholm]]. In the center of the charred town, they find a small campfire surrounded by three elven children—an older girl and two younger boys, ages 6–8. The party approaches cautiously; the kids are equally guarded.

The children explain [[The Royal Guard]] killed their parents and they’ve been wandering alone, scavenging for food. Matt gives them rations. Aelrin, however, magically conjures the smell of sizzling steak to trick the kids into trading him their rations. Matt snaps at him, and Aelrin remorsefully gives the food back. The party ultimately decides to take the children with them. Eryn rides with the kids while Aelrin walks beside the horse.

Upon reaching the outskirts, they spot two Royal Guards.  
Aelrin casts Heat Metal, roasting one guard alive in his own armor. He finishes the other with Poison Spray. Heat Metal leaves Aelrin with a sharp pain and the whisper of Kaelrath’s satisfaction in his ear. The orb grows warm.

Matt considers using his axe but, overcome by an otherworldly feeling, uses [[Blade of Honor|Vornhal]] instead.

Inside the city, Eryn leads the kids to safety while Matt and Aelrin ask around for the hidden rebels. One old man refuses to speak to them after Aelrin asks if he “likes gay people.” Aelrin then turns to a spruce tree for help, a tree named Bruce, ho tells him he overheard an elf and a tiefling talking about “the barn.” Aelrin has Matt shake some snow off Bruce, who says, “Thank you, Daddy Aelrin.”

While searching for barns, they spot Atlas Stahl in the town square, walking directly toward Eryn with lethal intent. But he sees the children. His demeanor shifts. He kneels, speaks gently to them, and the children laugh. Then he walks away.

This rattles everyone.

The party finds two barns. They split up. Aelrin unlocks one with his sickle but finds nothing inside. As he leaves, the barn erupts into flames.

Matt breaks into the second barn and discovers a stairway leading to an underground storage room, abandoned, no rebels inside.

They regroup outside to find the rebels already safely evacuated from the burning barn. Eryn explains: Atlas found the hideout, but instead of executing the rebels, he evacuated them himself, then set the barn ablaze to stage a massacre.

The party confronts Atlas. They learn he acted on instinct, not on Mara’s orders, and he doesn’t know why he spared them. When Matt reacts in disbelief, Atlas attacks him in a sudden burst of anger before [[Mara Albretcht|Mara]] restrains him. The pair leave the city shortly after.

The party speaks with the rebels, including the elf and tiefling Bruce mentioned, who decide to relocate to the other, intact barn. With the civilians safe for now, the party gathers their things, checks on the children, and prepares to return to Vanguard Cirene with news of Atlas’s unexpected mercy.
