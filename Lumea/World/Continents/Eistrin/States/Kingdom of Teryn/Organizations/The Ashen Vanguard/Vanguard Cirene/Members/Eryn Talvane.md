# Biography !hide
Born in Aeloria to a human dockhand and a vanished elven mother. When she was young, but old enough to remember Aeloria, her and her father moved to the slums of the Teryn Capitol. Eryn Talvane learned to survive by wit and shadow. Her half-elven blood made her an outcast, but her curiosity drew her into old libraries and whispered stories of rebellion.

When she witnessed a Vanguard courier’s execution, Eryn took their satchel and delivered the message herself, an act that earned her quiet recruitment. From then on, she worked the underbelly of Teryn’s cities, moving secrets through backstreets and border posts.

Her missions eventually carried her east, to [[Vanguard Cirene]], where her skills in infiltration and intelligence made her indispensable. Now stationed there, Eryn serves as one of the Vanguard’s sharpest eyes and one of the first to uncover whispers of Kaelrath’s name resurfacing in the kingdom’s shadow. Eryn is driven by something deeper, a need to expose the lies that built Teryn’s order and to make the world answer for what it did to people like her.
# Motivations !hide
Eryn is driven by a mix of justice, survival, and proving herself. Growing up in Teryn’s slums as a half-elf, she experienced systemic cruelty and saw how easily the powerful could crush ordinary people. She joined the Ashen Vanguard partly out of a desire to protect those who cannot protect themselves, partly to find a place where she belongs, and partly to test her own limits. Eryn wants to uncover corruption and expose the lies of Teryn’s rulers, but she’s also motivated by a personal need to earn respect and trust, both from her peers and from herself. Her cleverness and resourcefulness are fueled by anxiety, she’s aware of how fragile her position is, and each mission is both a chance to make a difference and a way to prove she’s not powerless. Deep down, she hopes her actions will create a world where others like her don’t have to hide or fear their identity.
# Personality !hide
Eryn is sharp-witted and quick on her feet, always ready with a clever retort or a plan when things go wrong. She carries herself with a practiced confidence, the kind that makes people believe she’s braver than she feels. Beneath that facade, though, her nerves are constantly at war with her resolve. Every mission sets her heart racing, every shadow feels like a threat, but she pushes through it anyway. Fear doesn’t stop her; it just means she moves faster, thinks harder, and hides the trembling in her hands behind a smirk.
# Quirks !hide
- Wears a bracelet she stole as a child.
- When shes scared she grins wider and talks faster, her “I’m fine, everything’s fine” mode. The more confident she acts, the more nervous she probably is.
- Hums old [[Realm of Aeloria|Aelorian]] street songs.
- Keeps two daggers, a polished and elegant one, and an old and chipped one. The chipped one is first weapon she ever stole, she never uses it.
