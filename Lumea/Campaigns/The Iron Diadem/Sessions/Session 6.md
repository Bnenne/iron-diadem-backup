# Summary
Following the clues from the stolen documents[^1], the Vanguard sends the party north toward a ruined [[Chapel of the Hollow Flame|Temple of Kaelrath]]. [[Eryn Talvane]], a nervous but clever Half-Elf operative, joins them as a guide.

In [[Thaylan's Hold]], they gather information, but a contact betrays them, luring them into a trap. After a chase through the streets and a confrontation with a spying [[The Clergy|priest]], they discover the trap was meant to push them toward the temple itself.

Traveling north, they encounter a group of [[Kaelrath Fanatics]], who they defeat after a brutal battle. The voice inside [[Aelrin Althir|Aelrin]] whispers louder: “Find me.”

At last, they reach the temple. Aelrin infiltrates it in rat form, discovering a hidden stairway leading deep below.  
Beneath the temple lies a sprawling ritual chamber, reeking of blood. Pools of crimson fill the floor. [[High Priest Marcion Vale]] and eight [[The Clergy|acolytes]] conduct a sacrificial ritual, an elf’s body dissolving into a pool below the impaled form of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]] himself.

As Aelrin witnesses this, the voice whispers again: “You found me.”  
He steals Kaelrath’s [[Bow of Judgement|Bow]], [[Thorns of Accord|Quiver]], and [[Warplate of Kaelrath|Armor]], and escapes.
