A matte dark-red orb, floating just of arms reach. No runes, no cracks-just perfect smoothness. Occasionally a faint, red slitted pupil opens across its surface, then disappears. Radiates a faint warmth.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
While attuned:
- You can use the Umbral Oculum as a spellcasting focus
- Your spell attack rolls gain +1

Once per long rest:  
As a bonus action, the orb opens its eye and:
- grants advantage on one spell attack
    or
- lets you see any invisible/ethereal creatures within 60 ft for 1 minute
# Curses !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

Each dawn, roll a DC 15 Wisdom save.  
On a failure:
- Kaelrath plants a thought that feels like your own
- These thoughts are subtle, not commands—things like:
    - _“You are wasting your potential.”_
    - _“Why bow to those weaker than you?”_
    - _“Power unclaimed is a sin.”_
Over time, they become more demanding.

Whenever you cast a spell at your highest level slot:
- Take 1d6 psychic damage
- The orb grows warmer
- You hear Kaelrath sigh with satisfaction
If you drop to 0 HP from this effect:
- You regain 1 HP
- Your eyes briefly turn red
- The orb keeps you alive for its own use

If you go more than 24 hours without casting a spell:
- The orb floats closer
- It whispers incessantly
- You gain disadvantage on Wisdom checks until you “feed” it magic
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
