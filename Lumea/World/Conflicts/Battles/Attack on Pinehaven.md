# Rewards
If they do well they get:
- Remembered for their heroism, especially by the children
- Winter gear, food, medicine, maps

Their performance is determined by how many civilians they save and they may only get partial rewards
# The Fight
## Phase 1
The party is able to ambush 8 corrupted soldiers who are attacking a tavern filled with civilians.
## Phase 2 
The soldiers get back up and the party starts panicking and they try something else.
## Phase 3
[[Atlas Stahl|Atlas]] appears but doesn't engage directly, only commands from a distance.
## Phase 4
Atlas is tired of this and joins in, backing them into a corner. This is when he pulls out Eryn and the children and demands the artifacts.
# [[Eryn Talvane|Eryn's]] Death
## ERYN'S CAPTURE
### Atlas's Demand !hide
> "The artifacts. Now. Or I start executing hostages."
> *He looks at the children*
> "Starting with the youngest."
### Eryn's Choice !hide
**Eryn speaks, voice surprisingly steady despite the terror in her eyes:**
> "Wait."
> *She looks at Atlas*
> "Take me instead. Let them go. They're just children."

> **Atlas hesitates. Just for a second, his eyes clear.**
> **Then Kaelrath's voice overtakes him:**
> "Sentiment is weakness. You offer nothing I don't already have."

>**Eryn's hands are shaking, but she keeps talking, that's what she does when she's scared, talks faster:**
> "You want the artifacts? Fine. But they won't trade while you're threatening kids. You know they won't. So let the children go, keep me, and you have leverage that actually works."
> Her voice cracks slightly
> "Please. They didn't choose this. I did."
### The Party's Moment !hide
**This is when the party can try to intervene but are stopped**
>**Eryn sees them trying:**
> "Don't. Don't make this harder."
> *She smiles that practiced, confident smile that's always been a mask*
> "I knew what I was signing up for. The day I took that courier's message and ran."
### Eryn to the Children !hide
**She turns to look at the three kids**
> "Hey. Hey, look at me. Not at him, at me."
> *The children are crying*
> "Remember what I told you? About being brave? It doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you do the right thing _even when_ you're scared."
> *Her voice breaks*
> "You three are the bravest people I know."
> *To the oldest:* "Take care of your brothers, okay? Just like we practiced."
> *To all three*: Matt's going to take care of you. He's going to give you the life I wanted for you. The one where you don't have to hide what you are. Where you don't have to steal to eat. Where you get to just... be kids."
> *Tears running down her face now, but she's still smiling*
> "Close your eyes now, sweethearts. Think about the stories I told you. The good ones. About the gardens in Aeloria, and the lights at the summer festival. Can you picture it?"
> *They nod, squeezing their eyes shut*
> "Good. Stay there. Stay in that story."
### Eryn to Matt !hide
> "Matt. I need you to promise me something."
> 
> "Promise me you'll get them out. Promise me you'll make it west. Promise me you'll show them what it means to fight for something that matters."
> 
> "I know neither of us asked to be parents. But we're pretty damn good at it, aren't we?"
>
> "Don't let them grow up scared. Don't let them grow up thinking they have to prove they deserve to exist. Just... let them be happy. Let them be safe."
> 
> "And Matt? Don't you dare use my death as an excuse to crawl into a bottle again. Those kids need you sober. They need you here."
### Eryn to Aelrin !hide
> "Aelrin. You're strong, you know how to fight and survive. You have the ability to help so many people."
> 
> "Don't let the artifacts take that from you. Don't let Kaelrath make you into what he's made Atlas. You're better than that. You've always been better than that."
> 
> "And please be kind to the kids, they actually adore you. They think you're magic. Don't prove them wrong."
### Eryn to Dutch !hide
> "Dutch. You're the smartest person I've ever met, and also somehow the dumbest."
> 
> "You've got that Mandate now. All that power. Just... remember why you wanted it in the first place, okay? To protect people. Not to prove anything."
> 
> "The kids need someone to teach them. To show them that knowledge is power."
> *Fading*
> "Build something beautiful, Dutch. I know you can."
### Eryn to Eggo !hide
> "Eggo. You never wanted to be a hero, right? Just a farmer. Simple life."
> 
> "But you stayed anyway. You fought anyway. That's what heroes actually are - people who help even when they'd rather be anywhere else."
> 
> "When this is over... when you finally get that farm... plant something for me? Something that flowers in spring. Something pretty."
> 
> "I'd like that."
### Eryn's message to Lira !hide
> "Tell Lira... tell her I'm sorry I didn't wait for her backup. Tell her she was right, I was too reckless."
> 
> "Tell her thanks. For taking a chance on a half-elf street rat who didn't know what she was doing. Tell her I hope I made her proud."
### Eryn to the Party !hide
**Atlas is getting impatient. His grip tightens around the spear.**
**Eryn looks at all of them one last time:**
> "I spent my whole life hiding. Being what people expected. Half-elf in a human world, human in an elven world, never quite fitting anywhere."
> 
> "But with you? With the Vanguard? With those kids? I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. Like I was... enough."
> 
> "So thank you. For letting me be part of something that mattered."
> 
> "Don't let him win. Don't let the King turn this kingdom into a place where kids like me, like them, have to hide what they are."
> 
> *Last smile, the confident one, but this time it's real*
> 
> "And hey... at least I'm going out doing the right thing. That's more than most people get."
> 
> "I'm ready. Let them go."
### The Strike !hide
**Atlas raises the spectral spear.**
**His hand is shaking. Blood runs from his nose.**
**Kaelrath's voice, distorted through him:**
> "Weakness must be purged. Sentiment must burn."

**Atlas, barely above a whisper**

> "I'm sorry."

**The spear comes down.**
**Eryn gasps. Looks down at the spectral blade through her chest.**
**She looks back at Matt and the kids one more time:**
> "Tell them... tell them I wasn't scared at the end."
>
> "Even though I was. Tell them I was brave."
> 
> "And Matt, will you take off the helmet?"

**She slumps forward.**
**The children are crying.**
## IMMEDIATELY AFTER !hide
### Atlas's Breakdown !hide
**The spectral spear dissolves.**
**Atlas falls to his knees.**

> "I... what... she..."
> 
> *He looks at his hands*
> 
> "Mara... Mara, what have I done?"
> 
> *Blood pouring from his eyes, nose*
> 
> "The voice... it said... it said this was necessary... it said..."
> 
> *He's sobbing now*
> 
> "I KILLED HER. I killed her and she just... she just wanted to save the children..."

**Kaelrath's voice, echoing:**

> _"You did what was required. You proved your loyalty. You are mine."_

**Atlas, broken:**

> "No... no, I don't want... I didn't want..."

### Mara's Arrival

**Mara runs over to where everyone is**
**She sees Eryn's body. The crying children. The party's rage.**
**She looks at Atlas with absolute devastation**

> "Mara... Mara, I didn't... The voice, it was so loud, I couldn't—"

**Mara says nothing.**

She just looks at him.

**Atlas, desperately:**

> "Say something. Please. Yell at me. Tell me I'm a monster. Tell me you hate me. Just... say something!"

**Mara, quietly:**

> "What would you have me say, Atlas?"

**Atlas:**

> "I don't know! That you understand? That it wasn't my fault? That Kaelrath made me do it?"

**Mara:**

> "Is that what you believe?"

**Atlas, breaking:**

> "I... I don't know what I believe anymore. I hear him constantly. Every thought, every breath, he's there whispering, demanding, commanding. I can't tell where he ends and I begin!"

**Mara:**

> "Then you've already lost."
## MARA'S CONFRONTATION
### The Truth She's Been Holding Back

**Mara:**

> "I've been making excuses for you. For months. Every time you crossed a line, I told myself it was the corruption. It was Kaelrath. It was the King's influence."
> 
> "But that woman? Eryn? She chose to die to save those children. She was terrified. She was twenty-one years old. She had every reason to beg for her life."
> 
> *Pause*
> 
> "And she didn't. She stood up, looked death in the face, and chose mercy."
> 
> *Her voice hardens*
> 
> "You had a choice too, Atlas. Every single step of this path, you chose. You chose to channel the Spear. You chose to let Kaelrath's voice in. You chose to kill that girl."

**Atlas:**

> "I tried to stop! I wanted to stop! But he wouldn't let me—"

**Mara:**

> "Then you should have been stronger. You should have fought harder. You should have chosen death over becoming this!"
> 
> "Do you know what she said to me once? Eryn? We met briefly. She told me she hoped to give those children a life where they didn't have to hide what they were. Where they could be safe."
> 
> "And you murdered her. You orphaned three children. You looked a woman in the eyes who was showing you what true courage looks like, and you killed her anyway."

**Atlas, sobbing:**
**Tears mixed with blood streaming down his face**
> "I know. I know. Gods, Mara, I know. It's all I can see. Her face. The children screaming. The blood. I can't... I can't—"

**Mara:**

> "Good. I hope you see it forever."
## THE ULTIMATUM
### Mara's Final Offer

**Mara:**

> "I'm going to give you one chance. One. Not because you deserve it. But because I made a promise to myself that I would try to save you."
> 
> *She pulls out a small, glowing crystal*
> 
> "This is a seal. It will suppress Kaelrath's voice. Block his influence. Give you clarity. But it will also cut you off from the Spear's power. You'll be weak. Vulnerable. Human."
> 
> *She holds it out*
> 
> "Take it. Walk away from the King. Walk away from this war. Come with me. We'll find a way to break Kaelrath's hold on you completely."
> 
> *Pause*
> 
> "Or refuse. Keep the power. Keep serving the King. Keep pretending you're not responsible for your choices."
> 
> *She meets his eyes*
> 
> "But if you refuse, I'm done. No more rescues. No more second chances. No more guidance. You'll be on your own."

**Atlas stares at the crystal.**
**His hand reaches for it... then stops.**
**The spectral spear manifests in his other hand, unbidden.**
**Kaelrath's voice, seductive:**

> _"Weakness. She offers you weakness. Without me, you are nothing. Without the King, you have no purpose. Take that seal, and you become what you fear most - powerless."_

**Atlas's hand shakes.**
**He looks at Mara.**
**Then at the spectral spear.**
**Then back at Mara.**

## ATLAS'S CHOICE
### The Rejection

**Atlas, voice hollow:**

> "I can't."

**Mara:**

> "What?"

**Atlas:**

> "I can't give up the power. Without it, I'm... I'm just a failure. Just another soldier who couldn't save anyone. Couldn't change anything."
> 
> *He dismisses the spectral spear, but doesn't take the crystal*
> 
> "If I walk away now, then what was it all for? What did I become a monster for? Eryn's death has to mean something. The King's mission has to be worth it. Otherwise I'm just... just a murderer."

**Mara, quietly:**

> "You are a murderer, Atlas. The question is whether that's all you'll ever be."

**Atlas:**

> "I can still fix this. I can still serve the King. I can still—"

**Mara:**

> "No. No, you can't."
> 
> *She closes her hand around the crystal*
> 
> "I see it now. You don't want redemption. You want absolution. You want someone to tell you it's okay. That you're still a good person despite everything."
> 
> *She turns away and tosses the crystal to the ground, it lands at the party's feet* 
> 
> "I can't give you that. No one can."
## MARA LEAVES
### The Abandonment
**Mara starts walking away.**
**Atlas:**

> "Where are you going?"

**Mara, without turning:**

> "Away from you."

**Atlas, panicking:**

> "Wait! Mara, please! I need you! I can't do this without you!"

**Mara stops.**
**Long silence.**
**Then:**

> "You've made your choice. Now live with it."
> 
> "When you're ready to truly change, when you're ready to give up the power, face what you've done, and accept responsibility, come find me."
> 
> "Until then... I have no more guidance to give you."

**Atlas:**

> "Mara, please! Don't leave me!"

**Mara, finally turning to look at him one last time:**

> "I'm not leaving you, Atlas. You already left yourself behind the moment you let Kaelrath in."
> 
> *Her voice breaks slightly*
> 
> "The boy I trained... he would never have done what you did today. And until I see him again, there's nothing left for us to say to each other."

**She walks away.**
## ATLAS ALONE
### What Follows

**Kaelrath whispers:**

> _"You don't need her. You have me. You have the King. You have purpose."_

**Atlas:**

> "Shut up."

**Kaelrath:**

> _"She abandoned you. Just like everyone else. But I will never leave. I will always be here. In your blood. In your mind. In your soul."_

**Atlas:**

> "SHUT UP!"

**Silence again.**

**Then he starts to cry.**

**Alone. Truly alone.**

> "Let them go..."

**The corrupted soldiers let the party and children go.**
### Matt's Scene with the Children

**The oldest child, barely holding it together:**

> "She said you'd take care of us. She promised."

**The middle child:**

> "Is she really gone? She's not coming back?"

**The youngest, not fully understanding:**

> "When is Eryn coming back? I want Eryn."

**Matt has to tell them the truth.**
**Matt has to be the parent now.**
**Alone.**

## WHAT ERYN LEAVES BEHIND

### Physical Items

In her pockets when they recover her body:

1. **[[Eryn's Journal|A small journal]]** - partially burned from the spectral spear's energy
    - Last entry, dated yesterday:
2. **A small sketch**, crude, clearly drawn by a child
    - Shows five stick figures: Matt (with shield), Eryn, and three small figures holding hands
      
# The Future !hide
I'm thinking King then casts off Atlas and tries to kill or arrest him or something but Atlas escaped and becomes a fugitive himself, then some time later he finds the party in the western territory obviously they hate him but he somehow finds a way to help them and he gets closer to them and Mara is there and is proud of him and them he takes the artifacts and the King takes him back. Also while this is happeneing the King has replaced Atlas with Cellan who is essentially Azula, and its actually Azula who gets the artifacts but gives Atlas the credit. The king then accepts Atlas back and now Mara is again very sad and disappointed
