# Summary
The party finds themselves in the bustling city of [[Honeymae's Haven]], within the province of [[Cirene]] in the [[Kingdom of Teryn]], on the continent of [[Eistrin]]. They meet each other in a local tavern and after bonding over their hatred of the King, decide to find some local work. Their first task: capture a local thief known as [[Sneaky Pete]].

During the chase, their use of magic exposes them, a crime in Teryn. They’re arrested and thrown in jail, only to be rescued by [[Lira Thorne]], a covert agent of the [[Ashen Vanguard]]. Lira brings them to [[Vanguard Cirene]], where their journey truly begins.
