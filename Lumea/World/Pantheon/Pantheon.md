# Historical Timeline
## Creation
In the beginning, there were three primordial beings: **[[The Shaper of Flesh|Osrynn]], the Shaper of Flesh**; **[[The Weaver of Flame|Ignivar]], the Weaver of Flame**; and **[[The Architect of Realms|Aetherion]], the Architect of Realms**. Aetherion formed the world itself, shaping the land, seas, skies, and the boundaries of reality. Osrynn created the first living beings, giving them bodies and the spark of life. Ignivar wove the first threads of magic into existence, infusing the world and living creatures with energy that could be shaped by those capable of wielding it. Together, their work established the foundation for all planes, life, and the flow of magical power. Once the world was stable, the three withdrew from direct control, leaving the laws of nature, life, and magic to persist on their own.
## The Rise of Gods
Once the world, life, and magic were established, lesser divine beings arose, entities born from the residual energy of the three creators. These beings shaped civilizations, guided mortals, and established domains of influence. Over millennia, the lesser gods multiplied, each attracting followers and building their own spheres of power.
## The War of the Gods
As these divine entities grew in number and ambition, tensions erupted. Conflicting ideologies, rivalries over mortal worship, and disputes over magical and natural resources escalated into a massive war, now knows as [[The Ochre War]]. Hundreds of god-like beings clashed, devastating mortal civilizations and reshaping the world. In the end, only a handful of gods survived. The three original creators remained, but they no longer intervened directly. Nine of the surviving deities formed the modern pantheon, seven gods of purpose, and two gods of death.
## Formation of Nations
Of the gods who survived the war, the seven symbols began governing regions of the world, establishing divine-backed nations. Under their guidance, societies stabilized, and cultures flourished according to the domain of each god. However, as the gods gradually withdrew from direct governance, the once-unified nations lost their central authority. Local leaders, ambitious nobles, and regional powers began asserting control, and over time, these territories fractured into smaller, independent nations. The cultural and political landscapes shifted, creating the patchwork of nations seen in the modern world, each shaped by the lingering influence of its founding deity but ultimately governed by mortals.
