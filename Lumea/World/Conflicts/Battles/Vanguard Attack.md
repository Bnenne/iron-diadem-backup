## PHASE 2: THE ARRIVAL

### When Atlas Arrives (End of Round 4 / Start of Round 5)

**Read this description:**

> The last Royal Guard falls, his sword clattering to the ground. For a moment, there's triumph—you've held them off. Vaelen raises his sword, about to call the victory, when the air itself seems to still.
> 
> The temperature drops. Your breath mists in front of you.
> 
> A sound like a thousand whispers fills the clearing. From the treeline, figures emerge—dozens of them, moving in perfect unison. Their armor is blackened, corroded. Their eyes glow with a dim, sickly red light.
> 
> And at their center: **Atlas Stahl**.
> 
> He stands with one hand raised, and in his grasp is a spectral spear—ten feet of shadow and malice that seems to drink in the torchlight. Black tendrils of energy spiral up his arm, pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat. His eyes are bloodshot, veins of black corruption visible beneath his skin.
> 
> Behind him, barely visible in the distance through the trees, you see it—a massive silhouette. The true Spear of Reverence, twenty feet of celestial metal turned black, driven through something enormous. The connection between Atlas and that distant spear crackles with dark energy.
> 
> "I gave you a chance to serve willingly," Atlas says, his voice echoing with two tones—his own, and something deeper, older. "The King's mercy is infinite. Kaelrath's is not."
> 
> He drives the spectral spear into the ground. The corrupted soldiers stop as one.
> 
> Then they advance.

## PHASE 2 STAT BLOCKS

### Atlas Stahl (Hexblade Warlock - Spear-Empowered)

_Medium humanoid (half-elf), lawful evil_

**Armor Class** 18 (Hexblade's Curse armor manifestation)  
**Hit Points** 150 (20d8 + 60)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 14 (+2) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 16 (+3)  
**INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 10 (+0) | **CHA** 20 (+5)

**Saving Throws** Wis +5, Cha +10  
**Skills** Arcana +6, Intimidation +10, Deception +10, Perception +5  
**Damage Resistances** necrotic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks (while Spear is planted)  
**Condition Immunities** frightened  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15  
**Languages** Common, Elvish, Infernal, Deep Speech  
**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP)

**The Spear's Vessel.** The 20-foot Spear of Reverence is currently impaled through Kaelrath's body in the temple. Atlas acts as a conduit - the Spear's power flows through him. He carries a spectral manifestation of the Spear that appears as a 10-foot shadowy pike, while the true Spear remains planted in Kaelrath's corpse. The spectral Spear extends his reach and channels the divine corruption.

**Hexblade's Curse (Recharges on Short Rest).** As a bonus action, Atlas places a curse on one creature he can see within 30 feet for 1 minute. The cursed creature takes an extra 5 necrotic damage from Atlas's attacks. If the cursed creature dies, Atlas regains 20 hit points.

**Armor of Hexes.** When a creature cursed by Atlas's Hexblade's Curse hits him with an attack roll, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack misses instead, regardless of its roll.

**Spear Conduit.** While channeling the Spear's power, Atlas can use a bonus action to command all corrupted soldiers within 120 feet to either move up to their speed or make one weapon attack.

**Corrupted Resilience.** When Atlas would be reduced to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point. This feature can't be used again until he finishes a long rest. (This triggers if they get him low - Mara will call him to retreat)

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Atlas fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Pact Magic.** Atlas is a 14th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). He regains his spell slots on a short rest. He has the following warlock spells prepared:

_Cantrips (at will):_ eldritch blast (3 beams, +5 damage each via Agonizing Blast), mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation

_1st-5th level (3 5th-level slots):_ armor of Agathys, hex, hold person, counterspell, dimension door, banishment, cone of cold

**Eldritch Invocations:**

- _Agonizing Blast:_ Add Charisma modifier to eldritch blast damage
- _Repelling Blast:_ Push creatures hit by eldritch blast 10 feet
- _Thirsting Blade:_ Attack twice with pact weapon
- _Lifedrinker:_ +5 necrotic damage to pact weapon attacks

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** Atlas makes two attacks with his Spectral Spear or uses Eldritch Blast (3 beams).

**Spectral Spear (Pact Weapon).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (1d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage plus 5 necrotic damage (Lifedrinker). The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of their next turn as black ichor seeps into their wounds.

**Eldritch Blast (3 beams).** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one to three targets. _Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 5) force damage per beam. On hit, the target is pushed 10 feet away from Atlas.

**Hexblade's Fury (Recharge 5-6).** Atlas channels raw hexblade energy. Each creature of his choice within 15 feet must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Atlas regains hit points equal to half the total damage dealt.

**Channel the Spear (1/Combat).** Atlas drives his spectral Spear into the ground, fully opening himself as a conduit to the true Spear. All corrupted soldiers within 120 feet immediately regain 20 hit points and gain advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. While channeling, Atlas cannot move but can still attack and cast spells. He gains resistance to all damage and his speed becomes 0.

**Cast a Spell.** Atlas casts one of his prepared spells using a 5th-level slot.

#### Legendary Actions

Atlas can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Atlas regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Move.** Atlas moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Eldritch Blast (Costs 1 Action).** Atlas fires one beam of eldritch blast.

**Spectral Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Atlas makes one attack with his Spectral Spear.

**Corrupted Pulse (Costs 2 Actions).** Black energy pulses from the spectral Spear. Each creature of Atlas's choice within 15 feet must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Counterspell (Costs 3 Actions).** Atlas casts counterspell.

### Corrupted Soldier (Kaelrath's Reforged)

_Medium undead, neutral evil_

**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor, corroded mail)  
**Hit Points** 26 (4d8 + 8)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 10 (+0) | **CON** 14 (+2)  
**INT** 6 (-2) | **WIS** 8 (-1) | **CHA** 5 (-3)

**Condition Immunities** poisoned, exhaustion  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9  
**Languages** understands Common but doesn't speak  
**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Undying Servant.** When the corrupted soldier is reduced to 0 hit points, if the Spear of Reverence is within 120 feet and Atlas is conscious, roll a d6. On a 4-6, the soldier collapses but stabilizes. At the start of its next turn, it stands up with 1 hit point.

**Hivemind.** The corrupted soldier has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed while Atlas is within 120 feet.

#### Actions

**Corrupted Blade.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

**Grasping Death.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the corrupted soldier can't use Grasping Death on another target.

## PHASE 2 COMBAT TACTICS

### Round 5: The Shock

- Atlas plants the Spear, gives his speech
- 8-10 corrupted soldiers advance in perfect formation
- Party's first attacks drop 2-3 soldiers
- **On the soldiers' turn:** The "dead" soldiers make their Undying Servant rolls
- 2-3 of them stand back up with 1 HP
- **Vaelen shouts:** "They're not staying down! What in the hells—"

### Round 6: Recognition

- More soldiers advance from the treeline (reinforcing to keep 8-10 active)
- Someone recognizes a face (Sneaky Pete, a prisoner, the trader)
- Atlas uses his Multiattack, targeting whoever looks strongest
- **Sister Brynna (if present) screams:** "Those are the prisoners! From Thaylan's Hold! They were turned!"

### Round 7: The Realization

- Atlas uses **Channel the Spear** as his action
- He drives the spectral spear into the ground, and through the trees they can see the TRUE Spear glow with dark energy miles away
- All corrupted soldiers within 120 feet regain 20 HP and get advantage
- The ones that were "killed" all stand back up simultaneously
- Black tendrils of energy visibly connect Atlas to each soldier
- **This is the "We can't win" moment**
- Vaelen: "He's channeling the true Spear! We have to break his connection or we're finished!"

### Round 8-10: Mitigation & Desperate Escape

- Party must choose their mitigation strategy:
    - **Disrupt the Spear** (magical attack on Atlas or the Spear itself)
    - **Knock him away** from it (grapple, shove, disarm)
    - **Environmental tactics** (collapse structures, create barriers)
- **If they succeed:** Soldiers collapse for 1d4+1 rounds
- **During this window:** Evacuation intensifies, NPCs shepherd civilians
- **Casualty moment:** Torren/Brynna/another NPC dies protecting someone

### Round 11+: The Retreat Call

- **Lira appears, bloodied:** "We have to go NOW! Western gate is clear!"
- Atlas recovers, begins channeling again
- More soldiers pour in from treeline (showing the army is MASSIVE)
- **Mara appears:** "Atlas! Stand down! We need—" (stops mid-sentence, looks at party with conflicted expression)
- Party must make final choice: keep fighting (TPK risk) or flee

---

## BREAKING THE SPEAR CONNECTION - Mitigation Options

### Option 1: Dispel Magic / Counterspell on Atlas

**DC 18 Spellcasting Check (to match his spell save DC)**

- Targeting the connection between Atlas and the true Spear
- Success: Connection severed for 1d4+1 rounds, soldiers collapse, Atlas takes 4d10 psychic damage and loses concentration
- Failure: Half effect, soldiers only stunned for 1 round
- **Cost to caster:** 3d10 psychic damage as the Spear fights back through the connection, artifact corruption flares

### Option 2: Grapple/Disrupt Atlas Physically

**Contested Athletics/Acrobatics Check vs. Atlas (+7 total, +2 STR +5 proficiency)**

- Trying to physically interrupt his channeling or knock him prone
- Success: Spectral spear dissipates, connection broken for 1d4 rounds, soldiers collapse
- Failure: Atlas uses Hexblade's Fury as a reaction
- **Cost:** Atlas places Hexblade's Curse on that character and focuses all legendary actions on them

### Option 3: Attack the Spectral Spear

**Attack the manifestation Atlas is wielding**

- AC 18, 40 HP, resistance to all damage except radiant and force
- If reduced to 0 HP: Spectral spear shatters, connection broken for 10 minutes, soldiers collapse
- **Cost:** When shattered, explodes for 6d6 necrotic damage to everyone within 15 feet (DC 18 Con save for half)
- Atlas can resummon the spectral spear as an action on his next turn, but soldiers stay down

### Option 4: Disrupt the True Spear (Requires seeing it)

**Someone would need to travel to where the true Spear is** (miles away at the temple)

- This is not feasible during this combat
- But establishes that the TRUE solution is dealing with the Spear at its source
- Plants the seed for a future mission: they need to go back to the temple

### Option 5: Use Kaelrath Artifacts Against the Connection

**If Matt uses Blade of Honor, Aelrin uses Bow/Oculum, or Dutch uses Mandate of Fire**

- Contested divine energy - competing sources of Kaelrath's power
- Auto-disrupts the connection for 2 rounds, soldiers collapse
- **Cost:** Artifact corruption intensifies dramatically, must make DC 18 Wisdom save or:
    - Take 2 levels of exhaustion from the strain
    - Artifact tries to dominate them (they hear Kaelrath's voice SCREAMING)
    - The "No Mercy" curse DC increases by +2 permanently
- **Kaelrath whispers through both connections:** _"Why do you resist what you already serve? Why do you fight yourself?"_
- Atlas NOTICES this: "You... you carry HIS relics? You condemn us for what you yourselves embrace?!"

### Option 6: Target Atlas with Stunning/Incapacitation

**Hold Person, Stunning Strike, etc.**

- If Atlas fails the save and becomes incapacitated
- Connection breaks automatically, soldiers collapse for duration
- **However:** Atlas has +10 Cha saves and Legendary Resistance (2/day)
- Very difficult but possible

## DM NOTES

**Pacing:**

- Phase 1 should be 4 rounds, make them feel competent
- Phase 2 Round 5 is the reveal, let it breathe
- Rounds 6-7 are realization and horror
- Rounds 8-10 are mitigation attempts
- Round 11+ is desperate retreat

**Don't Pull Punches:**

- Kill an NPC they like
- Make the corrupted soldiers' faces recognizable
- Have Atlas be genuinely overwhelming
- Show the scale - there are DOZENS more in the treeline

**But Give Them Agency:**

- Their mitigation CAN work
- They CAN save people
- Their choices matter
- Fleeing is the smart choice, not cowardice

**Atlas's Characterization:**

- Cold, certain, powerful
- But that moment of doubt when Mara stops him
- He believes he's right, but the cracks are showing
- "You cling to corruption" = he thinks the artifacts they carry are corrupting THEM
