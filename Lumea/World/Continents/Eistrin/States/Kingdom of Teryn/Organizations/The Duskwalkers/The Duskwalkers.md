# Summary
Led largely by Tieflings and half-orcs, the Duskwalkers operate underground routes that smuggle oppressed peoples out of the [East](Eastern%20Territory.md) and into the safety of the [West](Western%20Territory.md). They despise the monarchy’s racism and militarism but focus on saving lives, not toppling thrones.
# Methods
Espionage, stealth, and sabotage of slaver caravans.  
# Symbol
A crescent moon crossed by a shadowed hand.  
# Reputation
Folk heroes to many, criminals to the crown.
