# Summary
At [[Vanguard Cirene]], the group meets the local Vanguard leaders and is tasked with an escort mission: deliver coded letters and accompany supply caravans heading east.

On their journey, they discover a strange forest strewn with massive black boulders. When [[Dutch Roebal|Dutch]] attempts to repair a cracked one, it bursts open releasing an undead soldier that they defeat. Later, the party must disguise themselves while passing through cities where they’re wanted fugitives. (Dutch, notably, disguises himself as a woman where he finds great luck hitting on men.)

During the caravan trade, [[Atlas Stahl]], a feared Teryn [[The Council|Council]] member, confronts them. A brief skirmish ensues before Atlas withdraws, leaving the group shaken.
