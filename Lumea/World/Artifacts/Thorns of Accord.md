This blackened quiver generates arrows of spectral light that burn through armor and flesh alike. It never empties.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
The quiver produces shadow-tipped arrows that can pierce magical barriers. You can use it to make ranged attacks that ignore resistance to nonmagical damage.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

Each time you draw an arrow, you lose 2 hit points as your life essence feeds the quiver’s magic.

The quiver feeds on your vitality, and its arrows mirror your emotions. When you attack while angry or fearful, the arrow’s tip bleeds. Each kill leaves a faint wound on your arm, 1 HP of damage that cannot be healed magically. Your body slowly bears a tally of your deeds, carved in faint crimson lines.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
