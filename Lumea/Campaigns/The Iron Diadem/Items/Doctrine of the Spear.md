Found on the body of a [[Kaelrath Fanatics|Kaelrath fanatic]].
> **DOCTRINE OF [[Spear of Reverence|THE SPEAR]]**  
> The Spear is no mere weapon, it is the wound of our god, and the bridge to His flame. When [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]] was struck down, His blood did not die; it burned. From that pain was born His new form, purer, stronger, unbound by mercy.
>
> The faithful gather His blood that drips along the Spear’s length and mix it into the **Rite of Reforging**, that we may share His suffering and strength. Those who survive the flame become His vessels.
>
> [[King Vaerin Albretcht|The King]] and his prophet [[Atlas Stahl|Atlas]] have partaken of this gift, bearing Kaelrath’s burden and His fury. Through them, the god’s will spreads through us, the world will burn clean.
>
> **In flame, order. In agony, truth.**
