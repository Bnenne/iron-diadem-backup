A thick sheaf of vellum pages, bound at the top by a warped celestial metal clip darkened to a red-black sheen, veins of ember-light pulsing faintly within. The text, written in divine script, shifts when read, phrases change subtly, echoing the reader’s own fears and ambitions. The metal smells faintly of ash and hot iron. The Mandate of Fire is said to be a fragment of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath's]] divine will, written when his body still burned upon the spike in the Temple of the Spear. The King of Teryn claims it to be a holy edict, proof that Kaelrath himself called for the cleansing war against Aeloria. In truth, the Mandate’s words were corrupted by the infection seeping from Kaelrath’s blood. Its pages whisper with two voices, one noble, promising honor and rebirth through fire; the other cruel, urging annihilation for purity’s sake.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
While attuned to the Mandate of Fire and using as a spell casting focus, you gain the following benefits:
- Flame of Conviction. Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus increase by +1.
- Voice of Command. You can cast command once per long rest without expending a spell slot. The target has disadvantage if they are of lower social or military rank than you.
- Warflame Channel. When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can add your proficiency bonus to one damage roll of that spell.
# Synergy
If a spell book or magical tome is bound with the Mandate of Fire, its spells grow stronger but unstable. Fire spells prepared from that tome have their save DC increased by +2.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

In battle, the Mandate’s curse burns hottest. When combat begins, roll a d6 at the start of each of your turns (May be done in secret by DM):
- On a 1, the Mandate seizes partial control. You are overwhelmed by divine fury, your next attack or damaging spell must target the creature that has most recently harmed or defied you, even if it’s an ally.
- On a 6, the Mandate rewards your zeal. Your next attack or spell deals maximum damage.

The Mandate whispers constantly, just below thought, urging you to pass judgment. When confronted with acts of defiance, heresy, or even disagreement, your pulse quickens and your hands heat with divine flame.
- Whenever you see a creature directly oppose or insult your authority, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to immediately act against them through words, violence, or magic.
- Even outside of conflict, your demeanor becomes unnervingly fervent. You struggle to express empathy or restraint, often speaking in the cadence of a sermon, your voice tinged with fire and certainty.
- Each dawn, the Mandate burns a single word into your thoughts "Purge." You cannot fully ignore it.

If synergy is active, fire spells automatically trigger the Doctrine of Purity effect when cast against a target who has not attacked you first.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
