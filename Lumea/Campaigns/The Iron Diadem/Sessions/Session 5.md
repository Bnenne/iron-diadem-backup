# Summary
The group attends a lavish dinner with nobles before the hunt.
- [[Matt Stonebridge|Matt]] and Eggo pose as local [[Eggo Bart|Eggo]].
- [[Dutch Roebal|Dutch]] masquerades as a noble’s son, with [[Gronk Buffonry|Gronk]] as his bodyguard.
- [[Lira Thorne|Lira]] poses as a scout.
They gather rumors about an upcoming royal ball and whispers of [[Pantheon#Historical Timeline|divine history]]. Mid-dinner, [[Atlas Stahl]] arrives, commanding instant respect. Most of the party feigns admiration, except Matt, drawing Atlas’s ire.

During the hunt, they’re split into groups: Matt, Eggo, and Dutch with Atlas and [[House Wirths|Frar Wirths]], Lira scouting for all groups, and Gronk left behind. Atlas slays a bighorn sheep with his spear. Later, a snowstorm hits mid-hunt, and amidst the chaos, Matt witnesses Atlas kill an Owlbear.

Meanwhile, the others take shelter in a cave, finding a frail Elf named [[Aelrin Althir]], who Dutch convinces the nobles to spare by claiming him as his servant.  

Atlas and Matt reunite with the group, but then Gronk bursts into the cave. Atlas kills him with an eldritch blast, to Dutch’s horror. The group buries Gronk in the snow.

That night, Lira bonds with Aelrin and, with his help, sneaks through the lodge. As a rat, he steals several documents
- A [[Temple Ledger]]
- A [[Mandate of Fire Verse]]
- A map of the royal ball

The party regroups and prepares for their next move.
