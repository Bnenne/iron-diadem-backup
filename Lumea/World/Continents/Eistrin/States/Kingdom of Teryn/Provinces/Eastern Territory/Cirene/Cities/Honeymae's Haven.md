Small farming village in the rolling hills at the base of a mountain

~450 people

Known for providing high quality ale/grain, cider/apples

Their wheat is a famous kind of wheat called Goldfield Grain and they’re the only village that farms it, this wheat is then used to brew Theryn’s famous Honeymae Ale

Apple groves dot the eastern hillocks, producing crisp, high-acid cider apples for Honeymae Cider popular in inns and trade caravans.

positioned at the intersection of two major trade routes  
  
Named after Honeymae Brellyn, a gentle but cunning matriarch who once bartered peace between rival orchard clans and planted the first Goldfield stalk.  
Local speech has a warm drawl, and idioms are often nature- or brewing-based (e.g., “sweeter than a comb in Honeymae’s Hollow”).

  

Technically under the protection of House Thaylan, a mid-tier noble family, but in practice, local councils and brewers’ guilds run the show.

  

To Thaylan Hold — “The Golden Verge”

Named for the golden wheat fields that stretch along much of its path near Honeymae’s Haven, and because it skirts the edge or verge of the mountain foothills leading up to the fortress.

The route symbolizes the village’s crucial bond with House Thaylan and serves as a lifeline of protection and prosperity.

It now also takes you up to the Newland  
  

To the Capital — “The Sunspire Road”

A long, winding route leading East toward Velador, the capital city, famous for its towering spires that gleam like the sun.

The name evokes the distant promise of wealth, power, and influence that the capital represents.

This road crosses varied terrain (plains, forests, and river valleys) making the journey a true test of endurance for traders and caravans.

The path also crosses through the mountains into the Westland
