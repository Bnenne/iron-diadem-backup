[[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath's]] mighty bow, Ccafted from celestial ashwood, its string hums with restrained power. When drawn, the air trembles; its arrows fly with divine precision. But the more one looses its arrows, the more they hear a voice urging them to punish without cause.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
Attacks with this bow deal an extra 1d6 force damage and ignore half cover. Once per turn, you may cause one arrow to split mid-flight, make an additional attack roll against another target within 10 feet of the first.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

Whenever you try to use another weapon roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure pull this weapon out and the DC increases by 1. (15)

When you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, the arrow turns on you. You must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d10 force damage.

You begin hearing faint voices after every shot, the whispers of the dead struck by your arrows. When alone or in silence, you see silhouettes of those you’ve killed, watching from afar. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing when in silence or low wind, the whispers drown real sounds.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
