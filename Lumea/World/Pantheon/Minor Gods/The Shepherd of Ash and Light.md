# Tenets
- Feed the hungry
- Clothe the cold
- Do not let flame become vengeance
- Walk beside the broken
- Your life is an offering, spend it wisely
# Myth
Once a wanderer with no home, the Shepherd traveled ruined lands teaching peace and bringing warmth to the forgotten. When he was slain by corrupt nobles, a great wind tore the world open and his spirit returned, brighter then before. Now his followers believe that wherever compassion triumphs over cruelty, the Shepherd walks beside them.
# Oath of the Lamb
Sworn to shield the weak and act as a living miracle in a harsh world.
