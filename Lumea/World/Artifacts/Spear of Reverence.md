A large spear at the bottom of the [[Chapel of the Hollow Flame|Temple of Kaelrath]], piercing the body of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]] himself.
# History !hide
Forged of celestial metal and once bright as dawn, [[God of Vengeance|Verrath]], a vengeful god, hurled these spears in the final days of the Divine War, striking [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]] and ending his reign among the heavens. Now buried deep through his chest, the spear has blackened to a dark, blood-red hue, veins of corruption pulsing faintly along its surface. Its blade is shaped like a great Roman spearhead, twenty feet long and a foot thick, its edges still impossibly sharp. Across the ruined plains of [[Stad]], dozens of untainted spears lie half-buried pale and inert reminders of the god’s fall but only this one carries the infection that festers within Kaelrath’s divine flesh.
