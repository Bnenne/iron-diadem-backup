### THE STORY (Part 1: The Cute Part)
## Dutch

> "Can I tell you something I've never told anyone?... I can't read, well I can read some but, I grew up in the slums. The kids are actually better than me at reading. Eth reads to me sometimes, I'm proud of him."
> Eryn smiles, staring into the fire.
> *Looks at Dutch*
> 
> "You were born into knowledge. A noble family. Education. You've had opportunities I'll never have. Don't waste them. Don't let that gift die with you in this war. The world needs what you know."
> "Okay, so. About two months ago, Caen wakes me up in the middle of the night. He's six, remember. Tiny. Standing next to my bed just... staring at me in the dark like a little ghost."
> 
> "If you don't mind... can you teach them? The kids. Teach them magic, teach them history, teach them how to THINK. Eth especially. He's so curious. He could be incredible if someone actually nurtured that."
> _She mimics his serious expression_
> _Pause_
> 
> "And don't just teach them facts. Teach them to question. To doubt. To think critically."
> "I nearly screamed. But he just says, very seriously: 'Eryn, I had a bad dream.'"
> _Small smile_
> 
> "Make them smarter than me. Shouldn't be hard."
> "So I ask him what it was about. And he says—"
## THE STORY (Part 1: The Cute Part)
> 

> _She pauses for effect_
> Eryn smiles, staring into the fire.
> 
> 
> "'I dreamed you left and didn't come back.'"
> "Okay, so. About two months ago, Caen wakes me up in the middle of the night. He's six, remember. Tiny. Standing next to my bed just... staring at me in the dark like a little ghost."
> 
> 
> _Her smile falters slightly_
> _She mimics his serious expression_
> 
> 
> "So I tell him that's not going to happen. That I'll always come back. And you know what he says?"
> "I nearly screamed. But he just says, very seriously: 'Eryn, I had a bad dream.'"
> 
> 
> "'That's what Mama said.'"
> "So I ask him what it was about. And he says—"

> 
**Brief silence. The weight of that.**
> _She pauses for effect_

> 
> "Yeah. So. That happened."
> "'I dreamed you left and didn't come back.'"
> 
> 
> _She clears her throat_
> _Her smile falters slightly_
> 
> 
> "Anyway. I bring him into my bed, right? Figure he just needs comfort. But then I hear rustling, and Eth climbs in too. Then Laena. All three of them just... pile in."
> "So I tell him that's not going to happen. That I'll always come back. And you know what he says?"
> 
> 
> "So now I'm in this tiny cot with three elven kids draped across me like cats. Eth's elbow is in my ribs. Laena's hair is in my mouth. Caen's somehow managed to kick me in the kidney."
> "'That's what Mama said.'"
> 

> _She's smiling again, but it's bittersweet_
**Brief silence. The weight of that.**
> 

> "And I'm lying there, can't move, can't sleep, thinking 'this is ridiculous, I need to put them back in their own beds.'"
> "Yeah. So. That happened."
> 
> 
> "But then Caen does this thing—he does this when he's falling asleep—he reaches out and grabs my hand. Just holds it. Like he's making sure I'm still there."
> _She clears her throat_
> 
> 
> _Her voice softens_
> "Anyway. I bring him into my bed, right? Figure he just needs comfort. But then I hear rustling, and Eth climbs in too. Then Laena. All three of them just... pile in."
> 
> 
> "And Laena mumbles, half-asleep: 'Love you, Eryn.'"
> "So now I'm in this tiny cot with three elven kids draped across me like cats. Eth's elbow is in my ribs. Laena's hair is in my mouth. Caen's somehow managed to kick me in the kidney."
> 
> 
> "And Eth—Eth, who barely talks, who's so quiet and serious all the time—he whispers: 'Don't go.'"
> _She's smiling again, but it's bittersweet_

### THE STORY (Part 2: The Fear)
> "But then Caen does this thing—he does this when he's falling asleep—he reaches out and grabs my hand. Just holds it. Like he's making sure I'm still there."

> 
> _Long pause. She's still staring at the fire._
> _Her voice softens_
> 
> 
> "I didn't sleep that night. Just laid there with them on top of me, holding Caen's hand."
> "And Laena mumbles, half-asleep: 'Love you, Eryn.'"
> 
> 
> "And I kept thinking... what happens when I don't come back?"
> "And Eth—Eth, who barely talks, who's so quiet and serious all the time—he whispers: 'Don't go.'"
> 

> _She looks up at the party_
---
> 

> "Because I won't. Eventually. We all know how this works. I'm a scout. I sneak into enemy territory. I run messages through war zones. One day, I'm going to not come back."
## THE STORY (Part 2: The Fear)
> 

> "And what happens to them then? Do they wait by the door like they did that night? Do they have that nightmare over and over until it's not a nightmare anymore, it's just... true?"
> _Long pause. She's still staring at the fire._
> 
> 
> _Her hands are shaking slightly_
> "I didn't sleep that night. Just laid there with them on top of me, holding Caen's hand."
> 
> 
> "They've already lost two parents. If they lose me..."
> "And I kept thinking... what happens when I don't come back?"
> 
> 
> _She stops. Swallows hard._
> _She looks up at the party_
> 
> 
> "I laid there all night, with these three kids draped across me, and I realized: I'm the only thing standing between them and that nightmare coming true."
> "Because I won't. Eventually. We all know how this works. I'm a scout. I sneak into enemy territory. I run messages through war zones. One day, I'm going to not come back."
> 
> 
> "And I don't know if I'm strong enough for that."
> "And what happens to them then? Do they wait by the door like they did that night? Do they have that nightmare over and over until it's not a nightmare anymore, it's just... true?"

### THE STORY (Part 3: The Morning)
> "They've already lost two parents. If they lose me..."

> 
> _She wipes her eyes quickly_
> _She stops. Swallows hard._
> 
> 
> "Anyway. Morning comes. They wake up. Caen looks at me and says, very seriously: 'You're still here.'"
> "I laid there all night, with these three kids draped across me, and I realized: I'm the only thing standing between them and that nightmare coming true."
> 
> 
> "And I say: 'I told you I would be.'"
> "And I don't know if I'm strong enough for that."
> 

> "And he says: 'You need to tell me every time. Every morning. So I know.'"
---
> 

> _Soft laugh_
## THE STORY (Part 3: The Morning)
> 

> "So now, every single morning, first thing Caen does when he wakes up is find me and say: 'You're still here.' And I have to say: 'I'm still here.'"
> _She wipes her eyes quickly_
> 
> 
> "It's our thing now."
> "Anyway. Morning comes. They wake up. Caen looks at me and says, very seriously: 'You're still here.'"
> 
> 
> _Pause_
> "And I say: 'I told you I would be.'"
> 
> 
> "Except... I won't be. One day. And he's going to wake up and say it, and I won't be there to answer."
> "And he says: 'You need to tell me every time. Every morning. So I know.'"

>

> _Soft laugh_

### THE ENDING (When alone with Matt)
> "So now, every single morning, first thing Caen does when he wakes up is find me and say: 'You're still here.' And I have to say: 'I'm still here.'"

> 
If Matt is there and engaged:
> "It's our thing now."

> 
> *She looks at Matt*
> _Pause_
> 
> 
> "That story I was telling everyone earlier. There's a reason I told that story. It's because I need you to be here for these kids."
> "Except... I won't be. One day. And he's going to wake up and say it, and I won't be there to answer."
> 

> "Because when that day comes, when I don't come back, I need someone to be there. To answer when Caen says 'You're still here.'"
---
> 

> *Quietly*
## THE ENDING (When alone with Matt)
> 

> "I need someone to hold their hands while they fall asleep. To let them pile into bed when they're scared. To be the person they reach for in the dark."
If Matt is there and engaged:
