A Human Senior [[The Council|Council]] member and older sister to [[King Vaerin Albretcht]].
# Biography !hide
Mara Albretcht was once the most respected general in [[Kingdom of Teryn|Teryn's]] history: brilliant, cunning, and deeply principled. Her troops called her The Silver Hawk for her unshakable calm and her ability to see the broader strategy even amid chaos.

When her father was dying, the crown was expected to go to Mara. She was older, more beloved, and already leading the nation’s armies. But [[King Vaerin Albretcht|Vaerin]], younger and more ambitious, had something Mara didn’t: a fascination with [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]] and the promise of “divine favor.”  
With whispers from priests and court magi, Vaerin convinced their father that a man with “divine guidance” would make a stronger ruler than a soldier with doubts.

After Vaerin’s coronation, Mara served loyally for years, until she began to see what Kaelrath’s influence was doing. The rituals, the corruption, the quiet executions. She stepped down as General, officially citing “fatigue,” but everyone in the inner circle knew it was dissent.

She stayed on the Council to watch, to protect what little good remains, and perhaps to quietly nurture the ones who might undo her brother’s tyranny.
# Relationship with Atlas Stahl !hide
- Mentorship: Mara trained [[Atlas Stahl|Atlas]] personally. He was her favorite student, not because he was the strongest, but because he listened. He reminded her of herself before the crown’s weight hardened her heart.
- Dynamic:
    - She speaks to him as an equal, not a subordinate.
    - He respects her deeply, even as he grows closer to the King.
    - She knows he’s being drained by the rituals, and it breaks her to see him still serving.
- Conflict: She wants to pull Atlas away from the King but knows doing so openly would endanger him. Instead, she offers quiet challenges, moments for him to reflect and hopefully learn.
# Relationship with the King !hide
- Falling Out: The King’s devotion to Kaelrath disgusts her. He sees her pity as condescension; she sees his faith as madness.
- Their last argument (years ago):
> Mara: “You traded the love of your people for the fear of gods.”
  > 
  Vaerin: “Fear is love that obeys.”
> 
> Since then, they barely speak outside of council. When they do, it’s venomous civility.
- Political Position:
    - She still holds a seat on the Council, but mostly as a formality, the King keeps her close to watch her.
    - She secretly uses her influence to slow Kaelrath’s spread: protecting mages from purges, diverting troops from massacres.
