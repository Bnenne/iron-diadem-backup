Once the radiant armor of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]], it now glimmers with an oily sheen. The wearer becomes a living avatar of war, faster, stronger, unstoppable.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
You gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.  
Whenever you take damage, you can choose to reduce it by half, but your HP maximum is reduced by that amount until you finish a long rest.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

If your HP maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect, your soul is consumed, your body becomes a hollow puppet of Kaelrath under the DM’s control.

When attuned to the armor, you occasionally find your body moving before you think straightening your back, tightening your grip, or stepping forward as if anticipating an order that never comes. You find you reflection doesn't follow you, it often salutes someone who isn't there or turns to face the distant war drums. In moments of tension, your muscles lock into a combat stance, even if you were sitting a heartbeat ago. Your pulse matches the rhythm of distant war drums no one else can hear, and sometimes, in the quiet, your hand rises in salute to something standing just behind you. You don’t remember choosing to move, only realizing, afterward, that something else remembered for you.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
