# Overview
Population: ~450  
Type: Small farming village  
Location: Rolling hills at the base of a [[The Ornery Steeps]], positioned at the intersection of two major trade routes  
Province: [[Cirene]]  
Governance: Technically under [[House Thaylan|House Thaylan's]] protection, but local councils and brewers' guilds run daily affairs
# Description
A picturesque farming village nestled in the rolling hills, Honeymae's Haven is renowned throughout Teryn for its exceptional agricultural products. The village is the sole cultivator of Goldfield Grain, a rare and prized wheat variety used to brew the kingdom's famous Honeymae Ale. Apple groves dot the eastern hillocks, producing crisp, high-acid cider apples for Honeymae Cider, popular in inns and trade caravans across the realm.
# History & Culture
Named after [[Honeymae Brellyn]], a gentle but cunning matriarch who once bartered peace between rival orchard clans and planted the first Goldfield stalk. The locals speak in a drawl with nature and brewing-based idioms (e.g., "sweeter than a comb in Honeymae's Hollow"). They have their Sundew Bloom Festival every Bounty's End, where villagers tap the first kegs of Honeydew Ale in the Sundew Bloom Square. After Honeymae Brellyn's death, locals began praying to her. Over generations, belief granted her minor divine power.
# Major Trade Routes
## The Golden Verge (to [[Thaylan's Hold]])
Named for the golden wheat fields that stretch along its path and because it skirts the edge of the mountain foothills leading to the fortress. The route symbolizes the village's crucial bond with [[House Thaylan]] and serves as a lifeline of protection and prosperity. The road also leads up to the [[Northern Territory]].
## The Sunspire Road (to [[Velador]], the Capital)
A long, winding route leading east toward Velador, famous for its towering spires that gleam like the sun. The name evokes the distant promise of wealth, power, and influence that the capital represents. This road crosses varied terrain (plains, forests, and river valleys) making the journey a true test of endurance for traders and caravans. The path also crosses through the [[The or|mountains]] into the [[Western Territory]].
