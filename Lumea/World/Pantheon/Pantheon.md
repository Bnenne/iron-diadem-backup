# Historical Timeline
## Creation
In the beginning, there were three primordial beings: **[[The Shaper of Flesh|Osrynn]], the Shaper of Flesh**; **[[The Weaver of Flame|Ignivar]], the Weaver of Flame**; and **[[The Architect of Realms|Aetherion]], the Architect of Realms**. Aetherion formed the world itself, shaping the land, seas, skies, and the boundaries of reality. Osrynn created the first living beings, giving them bodies and the spark of life. Ignivar wove the first threads of magic into existence, infusing the world and living creatures with energy that could be shaped by those capable of wielding it. Together, their work established the foundation for all planes, life, and the flow of magical power. Once the world was stable, the three withdrew from direct control, leaving the laws of nature, life, and magic to persist on their own.
## The Rise of Gods
Once the world, life, and magic were established, lesser divine beings arose, entities born from the residual energy of the three creators. These beings shaped civilizations, guided mortals, and established domains of influence. Over millennia, the lesser gods multiplied, each attracting followers and building their own spheres of power.
## The War of the Gods
As these divine entities grew in number and ambition, tensions erupted. Conflicting ideologies, rivalries over mortal worship, and disputes over magical and natural resources escalated into a massive war, now knows as [[The Ochre War]]. Hundreds of god-like beings clashed, devastating mortal civilizations and reshaping the world. In the end, only a handful of gods survived. The three original creators remained, but they no longer intervened directly. Nine of the surviving deities formed the modern pantheon, seven gods of purpose, and two gods of death.
## The Rise of Minor Gods
In the aftermath of the Ochre War, the divine landscape did not remain static. As the Nine withdrew from direct intervention and mortal civilizations rebuilt, new forms of divinity emerged to fill the spaces between the great powers. Some were survivors of the war itself, diminished gods who had lost much of their strength but retained enough divine essence to persist in isolated regions, gathering devoted followers who remembered the old ways. Others arose through mortal belief itself: exceptional individuals whose deeds became legend, their names invoked so fervently that collective faith eventually granted them a spark of true divinity. Saints, heroes, and ancestors ascended to become patrons of specific cities, trades, or natural phenomena. Still others were aspects or offspring of the Nine, lesser emanations of divine power that mortals could approach more readily than the distant major gods. In the borderlands between the divine and mortal realms, powerful spirits, archfey, primordial elementals, and ancient nature guardians, began receiving worship, their power growing until they too blurred the line between spirit and deity. These minor gods found their niches in the daily lives of common folk: the ferryman's prayer to the river guardian, the midwife's invocation of the birth-bringer, the traveler's offering at the crossroads shrine. While the major temples preached the supremacy of the Nine, village shrines and household altars told a different story, one of countless small divinities woven into the fabric of everyday existence.
## Formation of Nations
Of the gods who survived the war, the seven symbols began governing regions of the world, establishing divine-backed nations. Under their guidance, societies stabilized, and cultures flourished according to the domain of each god. However, as the gods gradually withdrew from direct governance, the once-unified nations lost their central authority. Local leaders, ambitious nobles, and regional powers began asserting control, and over time, these territories fractured into smaller, independent nations. The cultural and political landscapes shifted, creating the patchwork of nations seen in the modern world, each shaped by the lingering influence of its founding deity but ultimately governed by mortals.
