Atlas Stahl, a young Human and member of [[The Council]], loyal to [[King Vaerin Albretcht]] and a steadfast and respected enforcer of royal will. Close to and mentored by [[Mara Albretcht]].
# History !hide
## Early Life !hide
Atlas was born in Aeloria to the same father but different mother than [[Aelrin Althir]], the half-siblings never met. Atlas's mother, trying to protect him from the chaos following Teryn’s invasion, smuggled Atlas out. She was eventually caught and killed by the royal guard for being a Human with Elven relations. Atlas, now orphaned, was taken in by the royal military as a ward of the state and groomed for command. He grew up believing he was human, never knowing about Eryn, and never questioning his loyalty to the kingdom.
# Connection !hide
Neither sibling knows the other exists. [[Aelrin Althir|Aelrin's]] motivations are rooted in fighting oppression and protecting others, unaware that part of his personal stakes may eventually collide with his own family. Atlas, as second-in-command to the king, is deeply committed to Teryn’s military objectives, and any confrontation with rebels could unknowingly bring him into conflict with his own brother.
# Quirks !hide
- Looks away when people get executed
# Skepticism !hide
- Inconsistencies in King's orders
	- The King claims he’s acting in the “best interest” of Teryn, but Atlas notices orders that sacrifice innocent civilians or rebel-controlled villages unnecessarily.
	- The King’s justifications might conflict with Atlas’s moral instincts, especially since he secretly retains some [[Realm of Aeloria|Aelorian]] values (from his childhood) that value empathy and justice.
- Observing Corruption Among the Royal Court
	- Atlas sees nobles and advisors enriching themselves at the expense of soldiers or civilians, while the King tolerates or encourages it.
	- He might discover the King is using propaganda or lies to justify actions he knows are morally wrong, such as fabricating threats from magic users or rebels.
- The King’s Relationship With Kaelrath
	- Atlas sees the ritual corruption growing in the King, who is now literally hearing Kaelrath’s voice.
	- He may notice that the King is becoming less human, more cruel, and obsessive, and that Kaelrath’s influence drives decisions that don’t even benefit Teryn but serve the god’s malice.
- Personal Cost
	- The rituals that give him power slowly damage his body and mind, making him feel trapped.
	- This could manifest as fading memories, strange dreams, or moments of extreme aggression, making him question whether this is truly “honor” or just manipulation.
- Encounters With Rebels or Innocents
	- Atlas might witness acts of courage, selflessness, or wisdom from the people he’s been taught to see as enemies.
	- Seeing rebels protect civilians or act honorably could conflict with his belief that all rebels are threats.
- Small Clues About the King’s Lies
	- He could notice records or events that contradict the official story about Aeloria, magic users, or the cause of the war.
	- Letters, secret meetings, or whispers from loyal subordinates could hint that the King is twisting history to consolidate power.
- Strange Magical Effects
	- Being involved in the Kaelrath rituals, Atlas might notice unnatural effects around the King: dark omens, aggressive spirits, or magical residues that feel “wrong.”
	- These could subtly signal that the King is being manipulated, giving Atlas a reason to doubt him beyond morality.
# Progression !hide
- Stage 1: Rationalization
	- When villages are burned, he tells himself it’s to _“root out rebels.”_
	- When innocents die, he insists _“order demands sacrifice.”_
	- When he feels the corruption burning through his veins, he convinces himself that this is what strength feel like, the cost of protecting the realm.
- Stage 2: Doubts
	- He sees a soldier executed for questioning orders, even though they were right.
	- He finds a falsified report about rebel movements.
	- He sees the King’s reflection twist unnaturally during a ritual, and for a second, Kaelrath’s eyes look back at him.
- Stage 3: Vulnerability
	- He unexpectedly opens up to the PCs, especially Aelrin who reminds him of his lost humanity.
	- The party witnesses him coughing up blood or needing to steady himself mid-fight. He insists he’s fine.
	- He lets the party live “just this once” because “something about this feels wrong.”
- Stage 4: Breaking Point
	- He sees a child or family killed because of one of his own commands.
	- He discovers evidence of Aelorian blood in his own heritage, breaking his identity as “the perfect Terynian.”
- Stage 5: Realization
	- He finally realizes that the King’s cause is not divine at all, it’s Kaelrath’s infection made flesh.
	- He witnesses the King performing a ritual where Kaelrath’s “blessing” physically harms him and the royal guard. Then, he King orders something that even Atlas, hardened by years of war, can’t carry out, destroying a whole town just to send a message.  
	- That’s when he sees what he’s become. And worse, what he’s helped the King become.
- Stage 6: Guilt
	- He starts disobeying the King and his orders and eventually confronts him, swearing off all of Teryn and leaving the Council forever.
- Stage 7: Redemption
	- He seeks out of the party hoping to help them.
