[[Session 7|← Previous Session]] | [[Session 9|Next Session →]]
# Summary
The party reunited with [[Dutch Roebal|Dutch]] and Eggo at Vanguard [[Eggo Bart|Eggo]] after their previous mission. [[Kela Harrowen]] distributed more of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath's]] armaments:
- Dutch received the [[Mandate of Fire]]
- Eggo received Kaelrath's [[Bow of Judgement|Bow]] and [[Thorns of Accord|Quiver]]

[[Lira Thorne]] briefed them on their most critical mission yet: infiltrating the royal ball at [[Thaylan's Hold]]. [[Eryn Talvane]] would accompany them.

Before departing, the party rested. [[Matt Stonebridge|Matt]] experienced a vivid nightmare of oceans of blood. Upon waking, he discovered his palms were stained red with blood.

The party traveled to Thaylan's Hold and successfully infiltrated the noble ball using carefully constructed disguises:
- Dutch posed as a noble's son
- Matt and Eggo posed as his bodyguards
- [[Aelrin Althir|Aelrin]] posed as his servant
- Eryn posed as a servant/waitress

Dutch engaged with [[House Thaylan|Borin Thaylan]], who invited him to a private meeting and asked him to bring a servant and guards. Dutch strategically selected Eryn, Matt, and Eggo.

During the meeting, Dutch learned devastating information:
Two Spies in [[Vanguard Cirene]]:
1. [[Kela Harrowen]]
2. [[Somu Solrehd]]
Imminent Threat:
- All [[Ashen Vanguard]] cells across [[Kingdom of Teryn|Teryn]] will be attacked tomorrow night
- This represents a coordinated strike against the entire rebellion

The party rushed back to [[Vanguard Cirene]] and immediately reported to Lira. They gathered all the [[World/Continents/Eistrin/States/Kingdom of Teryn/Organizations/The Ashen Vanguard/Vanguard Cirene/Vanguard Cirene#Leadership|Vanguard leaders]] except Kela to discuss the situation.

The party confronted Kela and used *Zone of Truth* to extract the complete picture. Her revelations were shocking:
1. Kela is posing as a spy for the [[King Vaerin Albretcht|Crown]] but remains loyal to the Vanguard
2. She didn't inform the Vanguard leaders or the party of her double-agent status because she believes they're being watched
3. She didn't know Somu Solrehd was also a spy
4. She has the ability to inform the other vanguard cells (though she didn't reveal how she's able to communicate with them)
5. Kela is part of another organization that also includes [[Mara Albretcht]]
6. Mara is not loyal to [[King Vaerin Albretcht|King Vaerin]] and is actively working against his regime
7. Mara is trying to help [[Atlas Stahl]] find his own path and break free from the King's and Kaelrath's influence
