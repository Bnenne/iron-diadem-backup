# Biography !hide
Born into an orc barbarian group, he grew up with father. Eventually his father passed and left him a box with his belongings. Due to a mix up the contents of the box got lost and instead a single acorn was found in the box by Gronk. Gronk, thinking this meant that acorns had an importance to his father then developed an obsession with acorns and a hatred for squirrels. He now travels the world gathering acorns and hunting squirrels.
