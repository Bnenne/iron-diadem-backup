A great curved blade of silvery steel, once wielded by [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]], now veined with black ichor. Once wielded to defend the righteous, it now feeds on violence, whispering promises of glory to its bearer. Those who attune to it find their strikes truer and their mercy harder to recall.
# Attunement
A character must spend an uninterrupted short rest (one hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it.
# Blessing
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a hit, the sword deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage  dealt.
# Curse !hide
Once attuned, a character cannot willing unattune except through magical means.

Whenever you try to use another weapon roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure pull this weapon out and the DC increases by 1. (17)

Whenever you finish a long rest, make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you must attack the nearest creature in the next combat, regardless of ally or enemy, until you deal at least 15 damage.

You feel uneasy when not in combat. The sword’s weight increases until it’s used to draw blood. After 24 hours without drawing blood, you have disadvantage on all attack rolls until you wound a creature again. You also begin to dream of oceans of blood, and each night’s rest leaves you with faint red stains on your palms.
# No Mercy !hide
When you are in a clear position of power over a creature (one of these is true): you have advantage on an attack roll against them; they are restrained, incapacitated, or otherwise defenseless; they are disarmed and you wield a drawn weapon while they are unarmed; or you can end a social interaction by ordering them and expect immediate obedience.
- **When the trigger occurs**, the wielder must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (adjustable by DM).
    - **Success**: You resist; you feel the pull, your jaw tenses, but you hold back.
    - **Failure**: You are compelled you must take at least one hostile action on your next turn directed at the target (attack, shove, grapple, or an aggressive command that forces them into harm’s way). The DM decides exactly what your body does if you protest.
- **Escalation**: Each time you fail while attuned to any Kaelrath item, the DC increases by +1 (cumulative) until you finish a long rest.
- **Mitigation**
	- You can spend **1 Hit Die** and roll — add the result to the Wisdom save.
	- **Magic**: _Lesser Restoration / Remove Curse / Greater Restoration_ reduces DC or heals accumulated failures (Greater Restoration removes the artifact’s forced compulsion entirely for the next 24 hours).
