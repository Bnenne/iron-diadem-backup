# Summary
The most politically moderate faction, a coalition of merchants, scholars, and farmers who want a representative government rather than a monarchy. They meet within an ancient hollow tree that serves as a neutral ground for debate.
# Methods
Petitions, local councils, and attempts to unite the other factions under peaceful reform.  
# Symbol
A ring of intertwined branches forming an open circle.  
# Reputation Naïve but respected — the voice of reason among chaos.
