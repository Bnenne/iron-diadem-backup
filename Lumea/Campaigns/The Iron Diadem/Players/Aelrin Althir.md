# Biography !hide
Aelrin Althir was born in [[Realm of Aeloria|Aeloria]] to a comfortable family. But three years into [[The Ochre War]] when the humans from Teryn invaded his city, his parents sided with them, taking administrative roles to gain wealth and favor. His parents abandoned their magic to appease their new overlords and pressured Aelrin to do the same. But Aelrin, haunted by the voice of a demon whispering in his mind, secretly practiced magic in the nearby woods. The voice urged him toward violence until he eventually learned poison spray and attempted to kill his father. When that failed, he was shunned but not outed. Later, seeing his family in public, the voice overpowered him, and his panicked thunder wave killed his siblings and several bystanders. Wracked with guilt, he fled into the wilderness, swearing off politics and power. His wandering brought him west, into the vast forests of Teryn's [[Western Territory]], where he found [[The Thornbound Circle]], a radical group of druids, rangers, and mages defending the land against the crown’s destruction. They welcomed him, and for a time, Aelrin found belonging and peace. But during a strike on a royal logging caravan, the voice returned, driving him to unleash uncontrolled magic that destroyed both soldiers and allies. Consumed by guilt and fear of himself, Aelrin fled once more, vanishing into [[The Ornery Steeps]], hoping isolation would silence the demon’s whispers, but through the thin, cold air, its voice only grew louder.
