# History
## Early Creation
The **Temple of [[God of War and Honor|Kaelrath]]**, formally known as the **Chapel of the Hollow Flame,** was built in the early years of [[Kingdom of Teryn|Teryn's]] rise, when faith in the [[God of War and Honor]] united the fractured provinces under one crown. The temple stands upon the ancient battlefield where Kaelrath’s mortal vessel was struck down during the [[War of the Gods]], his divine form pierced by a massive obsidian spear. While the surviving gods ascended beyond the mortal realm, Kaelrath did not, his body remained, suspended in eternal stillness. Fearing the panic and heresy that knowledge of his failure would cause, the earliest clerics of Teryn concealed the truth, proclaiming that Kaelrath had ascended alongside the others. The temple became both his tomb and his prison, tended by silent [[The Clergy|Clergy]] who were sworn to guard the secret that their god still lingered within the mortal plane.
## Modern Influence and Corruption
In the reign of [[King Vaerin Albretcht]], that secret was unearthed. The king, obsessed with securing divine legitimacy for his wars and rule, turned to the guidance of his most trusted advisor, [[Atlas Stahl]], and together they uncovered the hidden truth of Kaelrath’s lingering presence beneath the temple. Believing they could awaken the god to bless Teryn's dominion, they performed a forbidden rite and made contact not with a savior, but with something corrupted. The divine wound that bound Kaelrath to his spear had festered through the ages, twisting his essence into malice. In forging their pact, Vaerin and Atlas drew strength from this darkened god, gaining charisma, authority, and unnatural power but at the cost of infection. Atlas’s body now decays as his mind frays, while the king hears the whispers of Kaelrath’s corrupted will, a divine echo urging him toward conquest and purity. The clergy maintain the lie of Kaelrath’s ascension, but deep beneath the temple, the impaled god still hangs, silent, seething, and bleeding poison into the heart of Teryn.
