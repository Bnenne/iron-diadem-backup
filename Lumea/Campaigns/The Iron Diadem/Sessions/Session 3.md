# Summary
The party returns to [[Vanguard Cirene]] and accepts a new mission: ambush royal caravans to disrupt [[Kingdom of Teryn|Teryn's]] supply lines.

They plan carefully, fell trees to block the road, and ambush the guards. After a brief fight, the group captures the traders and steals the cargo.
